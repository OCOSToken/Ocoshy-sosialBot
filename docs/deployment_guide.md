# Ocoshy Bot ‚Äì Professional Deployment Guide

This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy **Ocoshy Bot** securely, reliably, and efficiently to production environments.

---

## üìå Pre-deployment Checklist

Before starting deployment, ensure the following items are thoroughly checked:

* [ ] Python (3.10+) is installed and operational.
* [ ] All dependencies (`requirements.txt`) are installed correctly.
* [ ] Environment variables (`.env`) are securely set up.
* [ ] Successfully tested the bot locally.
* [ ] Docker and Docker Compose are installed (if containerization is desired).

## üê≥ Deploying with Docker

Docker provides a clean and consistent environment for deploying Ocoshy Bot.

### 1. Dockerfile Overview

Create a Dockerfile to encapsulate bot dependencies and runtime environment:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the bot source code
COPY . .

# Entry point for running the bot
CMD ["python", "src/main.py"]
```

### 2. Docker Compose

Simplify management using Docker Compose. Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  ocoshy_bot:
    build: .
    container_name: ocoshy_bot
    env_file:
      - .env
    restart: unless-stopped
    logging:
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```

### 3. Building and Running the Container

Build and run your bot container using:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to Cloud Providers

### üîπ AWS EC2

* Launch a new EC2 instance (Ubuntu recommended).
* Connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-ip
```

* Install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

* Deploy the bot:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ocoshy-bot.git
cd ocoshy-bot
docker-compose up -d
```

### üîπ Azure App Service

* Create a new Azure Web App.
* Select runtime stack as Docker container.
* Configure Azure to pull directly from GitHub or Docker Hub.

### üîπ DigitalOcean App Platform

* Create an app via DigitalOcean App Platform.
* Link the GitHub repository.
* Choose the Dockerfile deployment method.
* Deploy and monitor logs.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

Set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment:

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Ocoshy Bot CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Docker
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Build and Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/ocoshy-bot:latest .
          docker push your-dockerhub-username/ocoshy-bot:latest

      - name: Deploy to Server
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          script: |
            docker pull your-dockerhub-username/ocoshy-bot:latest
            docker-compose down
            docker-compose up -d
```

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

* Utilize tools such as:

  * **Loguru** for structured logging.
  * **Docker logs** for container status (`docker logs ocoshy_bot`).
  * **Grafana/Prometheus** for comprehensive analytics (optional).

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

* Store sensitive keys (`.env`) securely.
* Regularly rotate API keys.
* Configure firewall settings for cloud deployments.
* Implement HTTPS for web-based interactions.
