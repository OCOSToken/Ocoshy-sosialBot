## üìÖ Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

Our standard vulnerability disclosure timeline is as follows:

| Step                             | Timeframe              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Initial report acknowledgment    | Within 24 hours        |
| Security analysis and assessment | Within 72 hours        |
| Patch development and deployment | Within 14‚Äì30 days      |
| Public disclosure by OCOS team   | After patch deployment |

If additional time is required, we will clearly communicate this to the reporting party.

## üîç Security Scope

**In scope:**

* Core Ocoshy Bot application source code (Python scripts, automation handlers, API integrations).
* Deployment mechanisms and CI/CD pipelines.

**Out of scope:**

* Third-party libraries or dependencies not directly modified by the OCOS team (though we appreciate notifications if issues are found).

## üö® Severity Levels and Response Times

We classify vulnerabilities using the following severity levels:

| Severity     | Description                                                                     | Response Time |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Critical** | Complete system compromise, unauthorized access, severe data leaks.             | Within 24h    |
| **High**     | Significant loss of confidentiality or integrity, critical function disruption. | Within 48h    |
| **Medium**   | Limited information leakage or minor disruptions.                               | Within 72h    |
| **Low**      | Minimal security risk with negligible impact.                                   | Within 5 days |
